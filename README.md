        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 29th August, 2019</h6>
        
        <p>My name is Ireoluwatomiwa (which means "the goodness of God follows me") Soladoye. Yes, I know I have a beautiful name you should want to be friends with me already.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>I am intelligent, a go-getter and I always find a solution for everything (Nothing is impossible to me with God). I have been on earth for 22 amazing years. I am shy and reserved on first encounter but give me sometime and you will literally beg me to shut my mouth. Somewhere in my mind I think I am a cool kid <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/creatures/Hopper-Cool.png" alt="coolkid" width="20" height="20"> but I don't think my friends agree with me <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/creatures/OhNoes.png" alt="coolkid" width="20" height="20">.</p>
        
        <p>
            I love Party/Firewood Jollof rice with Fried meat and fried plantain. The thought of eating this gives me the chills. YES I love food that much. </p>
          <p>  I love God and always make sure I spend time with him everyday. It helps my relationship with him grow. If you don't have a relationship with God you should because God is amazing. Trust me when I say that.
          </p>
          <p id="important"> Oh! one more important detail about me is that I LIKE SHAKARA. That's it for now about me. Stick to my blog and you will definitely learn more and we could even become friends. Nice right?

        <h2>My Software Engineering Journey</h2>
        <p>I have always had a nack for putting pieces of details here and there together to form one masterpiece. Coming up with new ideas, recipes etc gives me a sense of fulfilment.
           <p> When I discovered software engineering, I was like WHAT! this is for me. The fact that as a software engineer my everyday job will be to create solutions to real-life problems using technology is pretty exciting. I know its not as easy as it might sound but guess what I am willing to put in the work and learn everything and anything that would help me become a world-class software engineer.</p>
          <p>  I made the decision to start a course in software engineering. I am still at the beginning of it and I am loving it. I know it will probably get tougher as i go up the ladder delving deeper into CSS and JavaScript, but hey, nothing good comes easy.</p>
            So Lets get it!!
